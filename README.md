# Crop-portrait
A small project made to automate my teacher's work at the start of the year when creating the classbook. He would take pictures of all students and manually crop and resize each picture to get a good portrait. This always took almost an hour for each classroom. 

This little script detects all the faces from all of the pictures in the same folder and crops them out in 200x300 portraits, reducing that work to a few seconds.

Face detection is done by OpenCV.

Made in Python 2.7
